    // One more thing: overuse of getters and setters
    //
    // Often, the first thing after creating a class and adding its attributes, getter and setter
    // methods are created for each of the attributes. This destroys the encapsulation principle
    // for which those methods have been defined! Only write getter and setter for those attributes
    // you really want to access.
